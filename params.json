You can use the packer tool on [Dean Edwards Packer](http://dean.edwards.name/packer/) page to create a packed JavaScript\r\n2. Pate the generated (packed) code into the textarea of the testpage.\r\n3. Hit on submit to get the unpacked JavaScript\r\n\r\n## Class usage\r\nActually the purpose of this script is not to unpack userinputs, it makes more sense to use it for automation, e.g. site scraping, where you need to get the unpacked version of a packed JavaScript to parse out link or something like that.\r\n\r\nAnd here is how you can use the class\r\n```\r\n // where $packedJS is the packed JavaScript that begins with \r\n // eval(p,a,c,k,e,d) or eval(p,a,c,k,e,r)\r\n\r\n $unpacker = new JavaScriptUnpacker();\r\n $unpackedJS = $unpacker->Unpack($packedJs);\r\n \r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
